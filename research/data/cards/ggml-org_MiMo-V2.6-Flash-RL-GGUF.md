### Source models
- https://huggingface.co/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL

### Notes
- The MXFP4 output keeps the routed experts at their native MXFP4 precision.
- The Q2_K output keeps the expert down projections at MXFP4, and quantizes the gate/up projections to Q2_K.
- Includes MTP sidecars (Q4_0 and Q8_0) for speculative decoding (`--mtp`).
- Includes a DFlash drafter sidecar (BF16 and Q8_0) for speculative decoding, converted from the `dflash/` subdirectory of the source repo.
- Includes a Q8_0 mmproj for the vision and audio encoders.
- Currently, the Q2 models do not use an imatrix calibration due to lack of one.
