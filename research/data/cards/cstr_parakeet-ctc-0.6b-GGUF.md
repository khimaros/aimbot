# Parakeet CTC 0.6B — GGUF (ggml-quantised)

GGUF / ggml conversions of [`nvidia/parakeet-ctc-0.6b`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-ctc-0.6b) for use with the `crispasr` CLI from **[CrispStrobe/CrispASR](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR/)**.

Parakeet CTC 0.6B is NVIDIA's 600 M-parameter English ASR model:

- **English-only**, lowercase output (matches the upstream training convention)
- **FastConformer encoder** (24 layers, d_model=1024, 8 heads) + single CTC head — single forward pass per utterance, no autoregressive joint loop
- **CC-BY-4.0** licence
- Strong WERs on the standard suite: LibriSpeech-clean **1.87 %**, LibriSpeech-other **3.76 %**, TEDLIUM-v3 **3.78 %**, GigaSpeech **10.35 %**, Common Voice **7.00 %**

This repo provides four quantisations, all converted from the upstream `.nemo` checkpoint via `models/convert-stt-fastconformer-ctc-to-gguf.py` (the same converter used for `stt_en_fastconformer_ctc_*`, since `parakeet-ctc-0.6b` shares the FastConformer-CTC architecture) and quantised with `crispasr-quantize`.

## Files

| File | Size | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `parakeet-ctc-0.6b.gguf`        | ~1.22 GB | F16, full precision |
| `parakeet-ctc-0.6b-q8_0.gguf`   | ~720 MB  | Q8_0, near-lossless |
| `parakeet-ctc-0.6b-q5_0.gguf`   | ~520 MB  | Q5_0 |
| `parakeet-ctc-0.6b-q4_k.gguf`   | ~455 MB  | **Q4_K — recommended default** |

All quantisations produce the same JFK 11 s transcript.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the runtime
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR
cd CrispASR
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc) --target crispasr-cli

# 2. Run — the CLI auto-downloads Q4_K from this repo by friendly name:
./build/bin/crispasr -m parakeet-ctc-0.6b -f your-audio.wav

# Or pre-download a specific quant via huggingface_hub and point to it:
python -c "from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download; print(hf_hub_download('cstr/parakeet-ctc-0.6b-GGUF', 'parakeet-ctc-0.6b-q8_0.gguf'))"
./build/bin/crispasr -m parakeet-ctc-0.6b-q8_0.gguf -f your-audio.wav
```

The `crispasr` CLI auto-detects the backend from filename — `parakeet-ctc-*.gguf` routes to `fastconformer-ctc` because the architecture is identical to the `stt_en_fastconformer_ctc_*` family. Registry key `parakeet-ctc-0.6b` triggers Q4_K auto-download.

## Model architecture

| Component | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Encoder       | 24-layer FastConformer, d=1024, 8 heads, head_dim=128, FFN=4096, conv kernel=9, attention biases ON |
| Subsampling   | dw_striding stack, 8× temporal (50 → 12.5 fps) |
| CTC head      | Conv1d(1024 → 1025), k=1; vocab 1024 SentencePiece + 1 blank |
| Audio         | 16 kHz mono, 80 mel bins, n_fft=512, hop=160, win=400 |
| Parameters    | ~600 M |

The mel filterbank and Hann window are baked into the GGUF (`preprocessor.fb`, `preprocessor.window`). BatchNorm in the convolution module is folded into the depthwise conv weights at load time.

## Performance (Apple M1 Metal, JFK 11 s, q8_0)

| Path | Median wallclock | RT× |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| crispasr ctypes Session, Metal | 0.46 s | 24.1× |
| onnx-asr (CPU EP, int8) | 0.72 s | 15.2× |
| onnx-asr (CoreML EP, int8) | 1.28 s | 8.6× |

(Apples-to-apples on CTC-vs-CTC at the same param count vs `istupakov/parakeet-ctc-0.6b-onnx`. See [PERFORMANCE.md](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR/blob/main/PERFORMANCE.md) for the full methodology.)

## Output convention

The upstream model emits lowercase, un-punctuated English. If you need cased + punctuated output, pair with the `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` ([cstr/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/cstr/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-GGUF)) instead, or post-process via crispasr's `--punc-model` (FireRedPunc / fullstop-punc).
